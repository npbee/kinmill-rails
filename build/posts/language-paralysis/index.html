            <article><p>I&#39;m sure like many
self-taught developers, Javascript was my first real programming language.
Regardless of its faults, it holds a special place in my heart.  It gave me that 
first feeling of satisfaction that you get after conquering a problem that once 
seemed unconquerable.  But, in the last year or so I&#39;ve been really feeling the
itch to go deeper, to learn something new.  </p>
<p>For the most part, I don&#39;t think I ever even entertained the idea of learning a
new language.  Learning how to program was one of the most challenging things
I&#39;ve done in my life and the thought of going through the entire process again
just seemed impossible.  But as I started to grow more comfortable with some
of the more advanced Javascript topics, a new language begin looking more and
more attainable.  And now, I&#39;m up for the challenge, but the question is:  What
the heck language do I learn?</p>
<p>I have some of my own irrational holdups that add to my dilemma.  You see, I was a
latecomer to programming.  I didn&#39;t start until I was 25, so I feel like I have
to make up for lost time in a way.  I&#39;m terrified of devoting a large chunk of time
to a language only to find out years later that it was the &quot;wrong&quot; language.  I
already know that this shouldn&#39;t be a concern.  There isn&#39;t really a &quot;wrong&quot;
language, assuming that I&#39;m picking from a pool of languages that are actively
in use by real companies.  Any language will add depth and context to my
existing knowledge and make me a better programmer.  Regardless, I feel like I
have less time to gamble with.  </p>
<p>Another dilemma of mine is that I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve mastered
Javascript at all.  I&#39;ve never been the jack-of-all-trades sort of
person.  I like to really dive in to something and know it in and out.  So I
have a hard time moving on to something new without feeling like I&#39;m &quot;done&quot; with
what I&#39;m learning currently.  Again, I know this irrational.  I&#39;ll likely never
be &quot;done&quot; learning a language, but it&#39;s still something I think about.</p>
<p>So, what to do?  Well, the short answer is to just pick something.  And that&#39;s
what I&#39;ll do but I&#39;ve made a list of some prerequisites:  </p>
<p><strong>Functional</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve started to fall in love with functional programming.  It&#39;s all the rage
right now, I know, but it&#39;s so very satisfying to me.  It&#39;s challenging yet
simple, and to me just kind of <em>feels</em> better.  </p>
