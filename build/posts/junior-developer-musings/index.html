            <article><p>I mentioned this in previous post, but being a junior anything when you&#39;re 30 is a strange feeling.  There&#39;s some pride to be swallowed and some humbling to be had.  But at the same time there&#39;s satisfaction in the fact that I&#39;m &quot;paying my dues.&quot;  I&#39;ve learned quite a bit so far as a junior and I thought I&#39;d share a few tidbits.    </p>
<h2 id="first-how-i-got-here">First, How I Got Here</h2>
<p>When I first began looking for a job, I wasn&#39;t <em>completely</em> inexperienced.  I had been doing personal studying for about three years.  I felt I had a pretty good grasp on front-end fundamentals and at one point I just decided that I was going to go for it.  I pondered the idea of attending a bootcamp to give me an extra boost for the job market.  I ultimately decided that I would see what kind of responses I could get on my own and use a bootcamp as a last resort.  My feelings on bootcamps could fill their own post, but I&#39;ll leave that for now.  Suffice it to say that through the magic of circumstance, I was able to find a job as a junior developer.  </p>
<h2 id="filling-in-the-learning-gaps">Filling in the Learning Gaps</h2>
<p>Like I said above, I did have some programming experience before starting my current position.  But even with that there are some things that I don&#39;t think I could have ever learned on my own: </p>
<h3 id="programming-more-defensively">Programming More Defensively</h3>
<p>In my past experience, I was programming small-ish apps as a one-man team.  This meant that I could easily reason about pretty much anything that was happening in the app at any given time.  But after switching to a scenario where others were interacting with my code, I quickly realized how important it is to not make any assumptions about my function inputs.</p>
<h3 id="not-taking-pull-requests-personally">Not Taking Pull Requests Personally</h3>
<p>I&#39;m a somewhat sensitive person and, like most people, don&#39;t like to be wrong, so it was tough for me to learn how to take constructive code criticism.  I&#39;m still working on it, but being able to gracefully accept code feedback will be a huge part of my future career so it&#39;s important to me to improve at it.</p>
<h3 id="better-commit-messages">Better Commit Messages</h3>
<p>Writing more descriptive commit messages is another thing that I&#39;ve learned the hard way.  It&#39;s quite embarrassing to read some of the horribly ambiguous commit messages whilst doing a pair-programming session.  My solution here (I&#39;m sure obvious to some) is to do smaller commits.  The more code I write without committing the harder it will be for me to concisely write out exactly what I did in that commit.  I&#39;ve also started to do more with <a href="http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html">squashing</a> if I feel that some commits could be condensed.  </p>
<h2 id="sensing-the-next-level">Sensing The Next Level</h2>
<p>As I&#39;ve worked in the past six or seven months as a junior, I&#39;ve started to feel less and less like a junior developer.  Rather than lurk, I&#39;ve actually answered a question or two on Stack Overflow.  I&#39;ve committed a tiny fix to a large open-source projects.  I&#39;m just generally feeling more confident about the code I&#39;m writing.  These are all things that I&#39;m sure I could have accomplished on my own, but it would&#39;ve taken a lot longer.  Having some peer validation goes a long way in increasing confidence.</p>
<h2 id="junior-is-an-idea">Junior is an Idea</h2>
<p>However, despite what I said in the previous paragraph it&#39;s very important to me to keep my confidence in check.  There&#39;s a sort of hunger that comes with being a junior.  A hunger to learn and prove yourself and that&#39;s something I don&#39;t ever want to lose.</p>
<p>I hope to always be a junior at heart.</p>
