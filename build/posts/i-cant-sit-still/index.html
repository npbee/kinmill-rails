            <article><h1 id="phase-1-static-site-generator">Phase 1: Static Site Generator</h1>
<p>When I was first entertaining the notion of having my very own site, I had
really only tackled basic HTML and CSS.  I wasn&#39;t familiar with Javascript or
back-end technologies of any kind, so a static site generator seemed like the
perfect fit.  I chose <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"> Jekyll </a> as my site generator
and for a while, it was good.</p>
<h1 id="phase-2-ruby-on-rails">Phase 2: Ruby on Rails</h1>
<p>Suddenly, I learned more things.  I had graduated myself from a complete noob to
a somewhat promising apprentice and I had my sights set on becoming a
full-fledged web developer.  After a long internal struggle of which language to
learn, I settled on Ruby and decided that the smart move would be to build my
site in Ruby on Rails.  So, that&#39;s what I did.  My simple site was a full-on
Rails app with routes, a database, and a deployment system.  Things were ok for
a while.</p>
<h1 id="phase-3-all-javascript">Phase 3:  All Javascript</h1>
<p>After settling in the web development world for a while, I found myself really
focusing more and more on Javascript.  It became my first specialty and I
decided to dive in deep.  Having my site be a Rails now seemed silly.  I was a
<em>Javascript</em> developer and my site was built with Ruby, even though building a
web app completely with Javascript was absolutely possible.  I rebuilt my site
for the third time as a Universal (<em>isomorphic</em> to some) Javascript app.  Using
the latest and greatest:  React, Koa, Babel, Postgres, etc.  It was my most
complex app to date.  </p>
<p>The problem?  I came back a week later to write a blog
post and I completely forgot how everything worked.  </p>
<h1 id="phase-4-static-site-generator-again-">Phase 4:  Static Site Generator (again)</h1>
<p>So now I&#39;ve come full circle back to a static site generator.  I decided on 
<a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a> this time because it&#39;s super extensible 
and it&#39;s written in Javascript.  Before rewriting the site for the fourth time I
decided to sit down and actually think about what problems I was trying to solve
for myself before going straight to coding.  You know, like a good developer
might do.  </p>
<p>Here are the problems I focused on solving:</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>Creating and putting my thoughts down is the most important part of the site.
It is, after all, a <em>blog</em>.  Writing a new post is now as easy as opening up a
new markdown file in the &quot;posts&quot; folder.  </p>
<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>
<p>Styling is the next task that I spend the most time on.  I enjoy going in a
tweaking the styling and trying out new things.  I use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>
 and <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">Autoprefixer</a> so I needed a way
to easily use those tools.  I have a simple gulp task for watching my <code>.scss</code>
files and recompiling.</p>
<h2 id="javascripting">Javascripting</h2>
<p>This site does not <em>need</em> any Javascript and that&#39;s something I&#39;m trying to be 
more mindful of in general with anything I build.  That said, I am a Javascript
developer so I wanted a way to be able to try new things and share them here on
the site.  I also wanted these experiments to be able to stand on their own
without needing any dependencies from the rest of the site and also the other
way around, meaning I don&#39;t have to include React as a dependency on the site
when really I only need it in one experiment that I&#39;m doing.  </p>
<p>So, my workflow in this scenario is the most complicated bit of the site.  I have 
a separate <code>labs</code> folder where I keep these experiments.  Anything in this
directory is treated as its own project.  Each project will have its own
<code>project.json</code> file and its own dependencies.  Really, they can just be their
own Git repositories so I can keep them completely separated.  People can clone
them and run them locally without any trouble.  </p>
<p>The difference in the context of the site is that, when deploying, I use 
Metalsmith to basically mash the project&#39;s <code>index.html</code> and <code>readme.md</code> together 
and then plop into a layout like any other page on the site.  So a project&#39;s
<code>index.html</code> would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs html"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">html</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">body</span>&gt;</span>

    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- CUT --&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">div</span> <span class="attribute">id</span>=<span class="value">"root'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script src="</span><span class="value">.</span>/<span class="attribute">bundle.js</span>"&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">script</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- /CUT --&gt;</span>

    <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">body</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">html</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>

<p>And my readme.md would look this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs md"><span class="xml"><span class="comment">&lt;!-- PASTE --&gt;</span></span>

<span class="header"># The Project</span>
...</code></pre>

<p>I cut everything between the <code>&lt;!-- CUT --&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;!-- /CUT --&gt;</code> in the
<code>index.html</code> and paste where the <code>&lt;!-- PASTE --&gt;</code> comment is in the <code>readme.md</code>
file.  This allows me to present the project in the context of the site, but I
can still develop the project separately.</p>
<h1 id="phase-5-">Phase 5 ???</h1>
<p>How long will this phase last?  I&#39;m not sure.  Hopefully longer this time.  The
different iterations of this site have been huge learning experiences for me
regardless.  I&#39;d like to think that I&#39;ve gained a little wisdom and that I&#39;m past the
point of trying to show off what I can do and now just trying to pick the best
tools for the job.  But I&#39;m not holding my breath...</p>
