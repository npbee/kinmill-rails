excerpt: Life after Javascript
---

I'm sure like many
self-taught developers, Javascript was my first real programming language.
Regardless of its faults, it holds a special place in my heart.  It gave me that 
first feeling of satisfaction that you get after conquering a problem that once 
seemed unconquerable.  But, in the last year or so I've been really feeling the
itch to go deeper, to learn something new.  

For the most part, I don't think I ever even entertained the idea of learning a
new language.  Learning how to program was one of the most challenging things
I've done in my life and the thought of going through the entire process again
just seemed impossible.  But as I started to grow more comfortable with some
of the more advanced Javascript topics, a new language begin looking more and
more attainable.  And now, I'm up for the challenge, but the question is:  What
the heck language do I learn?

I have some of my own irrational holdups that add to my dilemma.  You see, I was a
latecomer to programming.  I didn't start until I was 25, so I feel like I have
to make up for lost time in a way.  I'm terrified of devoting a large chunk of time
to a language only to find out years later that it was the "wrong" language.  I
already know that this shouldn't be a concern.  There isn't really a "wrong"
language, assuming that I'm picking from a pool of languages that are actively
in use by real companies.  Any language will add depth and context to my
existing knowledge and make me a better programmer.  Regardless, I feel like I
have less time to gamble with.  

Another dilemma of mine is that I don't feel like I've mastered
Javascript at all.  I've never been the jack-of-all-trades sort of
person.  I like to really dive in to something and know it in and out.  So I
have a hard time moving on to something new without feeling like I'm "done" with
what I'm learning currently.  Again, I know this irrational.  I'll likely never
be "done" learning a language, but it's still something I think about.

So, what to do?  Well, the short answer is to just pick something.  And that's
what I'll do but I've made a list of some prerequisites:  

**Functional**

I've started to fall in love with functional programming.  It's all the rage
right now, I know, but it's so very satisfying to me.  It's challenging yet
simple, and to me just kind of _feels_ better.
