excerpt: Life after Javascript
---

Like many
self-taught developers, Javascript was my first real programming language.
Regardless of its faults, it holds a special place in my heart.  It gave me that 
first feeling of satisfaction that you get after conquering a problem that once 
seemed unconquerable.  But, in the last year or so I've been really feeling the
itch to go deeper, to learn something new.  

For the most part, I don't think I ever even entertained the idea of learning a
new language.  Learning how to program was one of the most challenging things
I've done in my life and the thought of going through the entire process again
just seemed impossible.  But as I started to grow more comfortable with some
of the more advanced Javascript topics, a new language begin looking more and
more attainable.  And now, I'm up for the challenge, but the question is:  What
the heck language do I learn?

## Background

I have some of my own irrational holdups that add to my dilemma.  You see, I was a
latecomer to programming.  I didn't start until I was 25, so I feel like I have
to make up for lost time in a way.  I'm terrified of devoting a large chunk of time
to a language only to find out years later that it was the "wrong" language.  I
already know that this shouldn't be a concern.  There isn't really a "wrong"
language, assuming that I'm picking from a pool of languages that are actively
in use by real companies.  Any language will add depth and context to my
existing knowledge and make me a better programmer.  Regardless, I feel like I
have less time to gamble with.  

Another dilemma of mine is that I don't feel like I've mastered
Javascript at all.  I've never been the jack-of-all-trades sort of
person.  If I'm choosing to learn something, I like to _really_ learn it.  So I
have a hard time moving on to something new without feeling like I'm "done" with
what I'm learning currently.  Again, I know this irrational.  I'll likely never
be "done" learning a language, but it's still something I think about.

So, what to do?  Well, the short answer is to just pick something.  And that's
what I'll do but to try and make the decision easier, I've made a few
prerequisites:

## Prerequisites

**Functional**

I've started to fall in love with functional programming.  It's all the rage
right now, I know, but it's so very satisfying to me.  It's challenging yet
simple, and to me just kind of _feels_ better.  I've been writing Javascript in
a more functional style and I want to focus on a language that was specifically
built with functional programming in mind.

**Relevant (to me)**

As a frontend developer, there are really only three native languages to choose
from:  HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  However, the number of compile-to-Javascript
languages seems to be growing steadily.  Things like
[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and
[Clojurescript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) are very interesting
to me.  Learning a compile-to-JS language seems like a smart move because I
could still potentially apply to my career as a UI developer.

## Candidates

Without further ado, here are some candidates that I'm considering.

### [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)

An ambitious choice, but when I started digging around for what the notable
functional languages were these days, Haskell was at the top of the list.
Haskell would be a pretty giant shift for me coming from Javascript, but I do
like a challenge.  The type-checking is a popular point for proponents of
Haskell and it is indeed interesting to me.  The syntax is also very appealing
to me.  

### [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

I _really_ like the idea of Elm.  I even went to a few meetups.  It's got a
Haskell-like syntax, it's functional, and it's specifically designed for
developing on the frontend.  It seemingly passes all of my prerequisites, but
I'm still hesitating on it.  I think it might be a little _too_ relevant to the
frontend.  I love developing UI's, but I'm not throwing out the idea of
venturing into more back-end territory some day.  It'd be nice if the next
language I learned would help me build up some skills in that domain as well.


### [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)

Clojure was the sleeper language for me.  I'm sure like many, the syntax almost
immediately threw me off.  But, I gave it a chance and it turns out, there's a
very good reason for the syntax being the way it is.  The very simple pattern of `(fn
arg arg)` removes a lot of the cognitive load for remembering how things are put
together.  Even though I've only done a few tutorials, I've already felt the
benefit of never having to remember how to call a function or what order things
were supposed to be in.  I'm also really impressed and excited by the
Clojurescript community, with things like [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om) and
[Dev Cards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards).  

## So...what's the answer???

I'm really leaning towards Clojure right now.  I'm in the midst of reading some
books and tutorials, so we'll see if it catches on.  

But really, my answer is to learn all of these languages.  And I will, someday.
