# Advertising

About seven years ago now, I was starting my first _real_ job as an ad trafficker for an online advertising company.  I was semi-fresh out of college with a Management Science degree.  Like most, I hadn't a clue about where to take my career.  Before the advertising company, I started out as a temp working mostly accounting jobs.  

The ad trafficking position did not excite me because I was passionate about advertising.  Rather, it excited me because the position was within a world I had always secretly wanted to be a part of:  the world of the web and technology. 

The job involved reading a lot of code, but never writing.  The majority of the job involved copying and pasting text from one program to another.  The atmosphere was nice, but I knew it was not going to be enough to keep me satisfied in the long term.  

Things had not yet clicked.

I had friends on the engineering team who would fascinate me with their ability to write "scripts" for things.  "How do you write these _scripts_??!" I would say.  I never quite got a straight answer and at the time never thought it was something I could learn myself.  

After two years I was ready for something new.  I was presented with two different opportunities within the company.  One position was as a sort of data analyst and the other was a junior product manager.  Both decisions would have just been another guess for me as far as career, but I was prepared for that.  But instead of choosing either of those positions, I played a wild card...

# Music

It was about this time that I heard from a friend of mine who had recently recorded and released an album.  He would be going on tour and wanted me to be a part of his touring band.  He and I had grown up together playing music.  The idea of traveling the country with him and playing music was both exciting and terrifying.  Anyone who's even had the slightest fleeting thought of being a "rock star" should understand that this is not an opportunity that I could pass up.  I quit my job, sold most of my possessions, and moved to Wisconsin to start my career as a professional touring musician.

Starting off, the touring life was amazing: road-tripping with your friends, eating good food, playing music for people and getting _paid_ for it.  Over time, like most things, it started to level out a bit.  I started to see it as more of a job: being away from home, eating unhealthy food, playing music for drunk people who are barely listening, not getting paid much.  I began to be honest with myself about who I was and what kind of personality I had.  I enjoyed being at home, having a routine, and not being away from my significant other.  I realized that I loved music and it would always be a part of my life, but not in the form of touring.  I love everything that I had been able to experience from touring, but after three years I needed something different.

Things had not yet clicked.

# Advertising (again)

I'm back in San Francisco.  Luckily I still had friends at my previous advertising company, so I was able to pick back up my old job.  Three years after I was about to move away from ad trafficking and I found myself right back in it.  It felt different this time though.  I felt a little wiser, a little braver, and hungrier for finding my focus.  I also came armed with a goal in mind.

After I moved to Wisconsin to begin touring, I started dabbling in simple web development.  The band I was playing with had a website, an awful looking website.  At the time I couldn't tell you _why_ it was bad, but I knew it was.  I had this innate sense of pride for our band's web presence and it was hurting.  I volunteered myself to take over the site.  I didn't think I could do any worse.  I started small with basic HTML, just trying to get it to work.  Then I started to learn CSS and Javascript and I ate up every video, book, and online tutorial I could find.  It took about a year, but I finally got the website live and working.  It wasn't the greatest, but it worked.  After this, things just snowballed.  I started writing code for fun.  I would write code from the tour van.  I spent most of my free time reading about frameworks and design patterns.

Things had finally clicked.  This, I decided, was my goal.  To be a software engineer.  

Back in advertising world, I lobbied (practically begged) my company to give me a shot on the engineering team.  They understood my desire to branch out, but could not give me any definite answers.  

I decided that I could not wait any longer and started applying to jobs.  It took a few weeks, but I found a company who was looking for someone to start immediately and I went for it.

I'm now almost 30 and have the title of Junior Software Engineer.  Being a junior anything at 29 is a strange feeling, but it's also something I'm proud of.  There are a lot of days that I wish I would have discovered web development at an earlier age.  I could have gotten a Computer Science degree and potentially been some sort of senior-level engineer by now.  At the same time, I've gotten to experience a lot of the world that I wouldn't have gotten to experience otherwise.  I _know_ that software engineering is a passion that I can make a long-term career out of because I've tried my hand at other fields.  Risk, adventure, and honesty opened up paths for me that I would not have otherwise seen and I encourage others to do the same.
