As you can see, I'm new around here.  I've decided to mark my territory
on the web and create a space all my own.  As much as I hate to crowd this place (the internet)
with more 'self-taught developers,' I wanted a place to display the work I've done so far and
document my progress as a developer.  I think it's important to have a playground of sorts to
code and design out in the open.  I've learned everything I know from others on the internet
who do the same, so I thought I'd return the favor.  I thought I'd start with a rundown of how I
built this here site.  I absolutely love reading about how others build their sites, so here goes...

In general the site is very basic, and I like it that way.  I set out to see how well I could fare with just
html, css, and vanilla javascript.  It was important to me to do things the hard way this time around,
especially when it came to the javascript.  Many of my projects used jQuery,
 but I wanted to really dig in and know what I was doing.  I now have a new-found appreciation for
 jQuery, but I also know when it's not needed.
