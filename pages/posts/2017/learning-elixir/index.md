## Elixir

I've always had some interest in learning other languages, especially functional ones.  I've toyed with languages like Elm, Clojure, and even Haskell.  I've found that learning other languages can unlock patterns and paradigms that you may have not seen before.  Even though these patterns may not be directly usable in your language of choice, they can still give perspective and sometimes make the patterns that _do_ exist in that language more understandable.  It feels like leveling up.

Getting the chance to work with Elixir for my first real venture into the back-end was very appealing to me.  I'm not sure I would have been as excited diving into something like a legacy Java codebase.  Elixir was also new to most of the other engineers on our team, so there was a sort of baseline starting point for everyone because we were all learning a new language.

### Impressions

Using Elixir so far has been fantastic overall.  A few things I've enjoyed:

- Documentation.  Everything in Elixir is documented really well as it's a first-class concept.
- Testing.  This is another first-class topic that has built-in support in Elixir.
- Mix.
- Community
