# Learning Elixir As A Front-end Developer

- Specialist vs generalist
- Similarities and differences
- Learning macros

I've always considered myself more of a specialist than a generalist, but at the same time I love learning new things.  I have functional programming lean.  I generally write JavaScript in a functional style and have interest in other languages like Elm and Haskell.  I've recently had the opportunity to learn and work on some Elixir and have really enjoyed it.
